The Clan of Embers is the only group to ever defeat High Rock and take their land, and High Rock has never ceased their attempts to take it back.

The Bretons have perpetuated violence between the two since the founding of the nation, and intense battles occasionally break out. Sheelba is the only half-orc to ever become Braduk, as well as one of the few women. She has faced criticism and challenges, and has met them with success and blades respectively.

The only alliances they can claim are a weak and tense one with Ticaret and a newly founded one with Ludzia; the former built from a common enemy and the latter a hatchet, buried with the corpses of thousands. Despite their enemies surrounding them, their might cannot be underestimated, as they have held against every incoming effort and pushed against them successfully.

   10. Plot Points: The Bannor are a demagogic nation led by Sabathiel, a half-celestial son of Raziel the Crusader.

The Bannor battle against the cursed Sidar, the mindless Aifon, the heretic Illians, the occult Sihirbaz, and the tyrannical Kolechar. The Hippus however, are not so easily demonized, as they are humans just as normal as the Bannor. The high commanders seek reasons to attack the Hippus to galvanize the people.

   10. Plot Points: The Elnofey maintain a region of ancient, uncut jungle that none other than the elves are allowed entry to. Only known from rumors, their homeland is shrouded in mystery and is said to contain beasts from the dawn of the earth and trees from even before. While the Elnofey venture beyond their borders at times, any trespass is met with swift death from poison-tipped points loosed by the undisputed masters of the jungle. Their poison is among the deadliest in existence, and is rumored to be made from an ancient tree.

This site uses [__jekyll__](http://jekyllrb.com). All submissions are able to and should make use use one of the templates found in the jekyll `_templates` folder (the `default` template is just fine).

## Custom Content
Submissions which add content which you think merit their own category should be placed in a folder on the root directory of the repo, named `TITLE-NAME` where TITLE is the name of your new category and NAME is the name of the submitter.
Once your pull request is reviewed and accepted, a link to your page will be automatically created on the site index.

Any assets you wish to use should also be placed in their own subfolder of `assets/`, named after their category (i.e. the `TITLE` of the content folder).

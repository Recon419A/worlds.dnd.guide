                        With the sun gone, the colossi roaming the barely-formed world died out. Temperatures rose and fell unpredictably due to the impenetrable, debris-covered sky.
                        It was into this the surviving organisms evolved. The organisms' skin changed from wood to stone or jagged metal, barring those in certain, well-preserved areas, which preserved their wooden skin.
                        These proto-demons reproduced when a bit of their core - essentially a hard, rock-like proto-brain - chipped off and assembled itself into it's own shell.
                        The size of their body was dependent on the size of their core, which animated the stone/metal that made up their body. The being would consume energy of whatever form it was formed from to increase it's size.
                        <br />
                        From this evolutionary mechanic different forms of demon appeared, ranging from the smallest (imps) to the largest (leviathans).

                        excrete poisons and toxins, and some even grew parasitic. The deep dwellers became most intelligent, though still animals: they learned to manipulate light and pressure, creating strong illusions to attract their prey.

                        members of packs began to specialize themselves, some hunting and others raising young, which was a brand new development.

                        Hundreds of thousands of years later, the pack mentality evolved into what could be called a proto-civilization. Still lacking a language or reasonable technology,
                        members of packs began to specialize themselves, some hunting and others raising young, which was a brand new development.

                        Over time, the planet's sky clears, and the demons begin to proliferate faster, signalling the start of the Age of Night. The power of the sun strengthened the heat demons, who forced the remaining frost demons into slavery.
                        It was also at this time that the Toxin Demons and Illusion Demons of the oceans began a rivalry, preventing as much scientific progress as the land demons, who had invented primitive tools.

                        The discovery of metalworking led to more durable tools, and a need for more metals. The enslaved frost demons were forced to dig deep, over the years creating a network of mines spanning most of the planet's underground.

                        The frost demons had been forced to dig mines so deep they stumbled upon a rare deep metal ore: A bone-white metal called icesteel, or "Dlarun" in the Demon Language.
                        This frosty, heat-nullifying metal became a source of strength to the frost demons, who eventually began to form their bodies of it.
                        This gave them a powerful advantage against the heat demons, and they revolted, forming their own civilizations at the planet's poles.

                        Over time, the crystal demons assimilated the poison demons to give rise to a new race: The Ether Demons. They wielded the powers of illusion, pressure, and toxins to form a new substance entirely: Ether.
                        They were able to utilize the ether to effectively survive on land, leading them into contact with the other demonic species, and were eventually dragged into the war between the frost and fire demons.

                        Thousands of years pass. War still rages between the flame and frost demons, seemingly without end.
                        It only stopped when a truly special thing was found by a young group of three outcasts who banded together for survival: the flame demon <em>Asmodeus</em>, the frost demon <em>Wendigo</em>, and the Ether demon <em>Axii</em>.
                        They had found a primordial energy which became known as the aegis flame. Unable to attune itself to all their distinct auras at once, the flame split into three, giving each the power of a deity and making them the first gods.

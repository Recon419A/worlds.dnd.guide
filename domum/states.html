# The States of Domum
Domum is populated by many different peoples. These nations all have one thing in common: The inner sea.
When the player story begins it has been six thousand five hundred and thirty years since "Calamity". Calamity is the event that created the Mortuary Chasm, a huge valley overflowing with magic that rests between Hohkirch and The Marians.
Legend has it that two eldritch knights fought there, and the warring was so fierce that they split the earth, creating the chasm and opening the inner sea to the ocean. It took civilization one thousand years to recover, and once they had indeed recovered from this Calamity they decided to sign a treaty to preserve the resource that was invalauble to all: the Inner Sea.
Today, any group not part of the Inner Sea treaty is considered barbaric, and not even the most war-like nations dare to break it. Due to a powerful magic, or just mutual need for this Inner Sea, is up to you to discover.

</p>
<p>
Ishen as a civilization is proud, based heavily on ancestral stories. According to legend, a tiefling named Seraph, who had rare, feathered wings fled the mainland to the Island of Ishen, and there established the nation by revolutionizing the natives there.
Seraph instituted a Council among the men he ruled, who would lead the nation in general. However, there
is a ruler called the “Seraph”. These Seraphs are more priests than anything, leaving the economy and
laws to the council and himself handling military, religious, or inter-political issues in the nation.

<br />
The Ishendi Government is as instituted by Seraph, with 9 members.
8 are elder tieflings and the ninth is the current ruling Seraph.
Society is essentially roman, with an oriental skin on it.
<br />
They generally allow all races, but tieflings, as rare as they are, receive special treatment. They may be exempt from taxes, or receive room and board as well as food for free.
Ishen is fairly closed off from mainland politics, and therefore seeing an Ishendi outside of Ishen are a rare sight to see.

“Land of Immortals” for their above-average medicine and propensity for time magic.

<u><center>History and Geography</center></u>
</p>
<p>
Historically run by a single king, the Marian Empire has slowly and quietly been taken over by a staunch
Aristocracy; with one family in control of each city.
<br />
All throughout the history of the Marian Empire there's been a clear divide between classes. Peasants live
in total squalor, and the working class barely works enough to survive. The nobility, however - live in the
utmost luxury.
<br />
The aristocracy has imposed many rules on society, making it reminiscent of old france and england, with their
extremely rigid social rules and gender roles. Beyond that, due to their unique terrain, they are practically infested
with many rare monsters. It is in this thread that the Witcher's guild HQ is build there, instead of in Balhaea, where
all the rest of the guild headquarters are.

The Marians are religious enough - they follow Lithan liturgy but not their doctrine - something that causes tension between them.
The church of Mary is usually the only place lower classes may seek refuge and aid; so it is kept by the aristocrats as a way of keeping
them in line. While Lithian priests tend to be fervent to the point of fury, Marian priests are more kind and forgiving, and represent the more "Lawful"
paladins.

The Marian empire is currently at war with Hohkirch over control of the Mortuary Valley for its magic wells and abundant rare ores.
The war was started approximately 15 years before over a minor border dispute that spiraled out of control of both governments.

The second oldest state in the world, Hohkirch is a Republic and Representative Democracy first and foremost,
but uses direct democracy for the purpose of creating laws. Citizens have passed laws making voting mandatory.
Over thousands of years, voters have decided to support the betterment of the people as a whole instead of the
betterment of the person, leading to some... questionable laws. The people, however, are actually quite fine
with the whole thing. Hohkirch has focused on production and improving their economy after it crashed several
years ago, and as a result have adopted a medieval form of communism. Strangely enough, the people make it work,
and everyone is quite happy with this economic setup.
<br />
Historically, Kirks have hated elves because of their percieved fragility, but embrace orcs
and their cousin races because of their hardiness.

<u> Resources and Magic </u>

Heptalithia is the number one <u>and</u> number two exporter of raw resources in the world.
The reason for this is that in the Merchant's Guild Tally, food is categorized seperately from the
other resources, and since Heptalithia is the foremost exporter of both, they are marked #1 <em>and</em> #2
in the category's collective.
<br /><br />
Heptalithia is also known for it's magic: they have a great knack for creating and using sonic magics and cold magic.

Fervently religious, this theorcracy is suspicious of any who are not immediately outward saints,
which is to say everyone.
<br />
Having only recently won independence from Heptalithia, they must build a history
and legacy from nothing. They have few resources, and treat their citizens almost as slaves,
all under the veneer of "it's the will of the Gods that we perservere".
<br />
Due to their identity as a holy nation of the gods, they despise tieflings for their
demonic nature, and Orcs/Half-Orcs for their supposed corruption from purity.
Conversely, they love and accept elves, seeing them as the pinnacle of refined beauty and
essential grace.

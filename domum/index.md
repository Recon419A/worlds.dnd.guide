# Domum
The world of Domum is large and fierce. Over millions of years, many civilizations have risen and fallen, culminating in an event referred to mythologically as “Calamity”. It took humanity one thousand years to recover, and eventually resulted in the creation of an “Inner Sea Union” 5,000 years ago. From there, states merged with others in order to consolidate power and ensure access to the inner sea. We are here now, in 6,530 A.C. (After Calamity). Now, only 8 major states remain, as well as the wildlands.

# The States of Domum
Domum is populated by many different peoples. These nations all have one thing in common: The inner sea.
When the player story begins it has been six thousand five hundred and thirty years since "Calamity". Calamity is the event that created the Mortuary Chasm, a huge valley overflowing with magic that rests between Hohkirch and The Marians.
Legend has it that two eldritch knights fought there, and the warring was so fierce that they split the earth, creating the chasm and opening the inner sea to the ocean. It took civilization one thousand years to recover, and once they had indeed recovered from this Calamity they decided to sign a treaty to preserve the resource that was invalauble to all: the Inner Sea.
Today, any group not part of the Inner Sea treaty is considered barbaric, and not even the most war-like nations dare to break it. Due to a powerful magic, or just mutual need for this Inner Sea, is up to you to discover (and the DM to make up!).

<h3 id="Ishen">Ishen</h3>
The Ishendi People, referred to as “An Ishen Man”, "An Ishendi", plural "Those Ishendi"

##### History and Geography
Ishen as a civilization is proud, based heavily on ancestral stories. According to legend, a tiefling named Seraph, who had rare, feathered wings fled the mainland to the Island of Ishen, and there established the nation by revolutionizing the natives there.
Seraph instituted a Council among the men he ruled, who would lead the nation in general. However, there
is a ruler called the “Seraph”. These Seraphs are more priests than anything, leaving the economy and
laws to the council and himself handling military, religious, or inter-political issues in the nation.

__Hierarchy__

 - Seraph
 - Councilmembers
 - Male Tieflings
 - Female Tieflings
 - Other Races
 - Slaves

__Misc.__

 - Regions of Ishen are immediately delegated to one of the 8 councilmembers.
 - Use of oriental weaponry with roman battle tactics.

__Popular Names__
 - Male:
    - Haik Rannen
    - Seraph Ozi
    - Mistin Soza
 - Female:
    - Ichi Rannen
    - Ah-sen Ozi
    - Seraph Soza

__Cuisine__

While willing to make “normal” food for outsiders,  in their own food they use many noodles, vegetables, and seafood.
Beans of any kind are seen as inedible.

__Government and Current Relations__

 - The Ishendi Government is as instituted by Seraph, with 9 members.
 - 8 are elder tieflings and the ninth is the current ruling Seraph.
 - Society is essentially roman, with an oriental skin on it.

 - They generally allow all races, but tieflings, as rare as they are, receive special treatment. They may be exempt from taxes, or receive room and board as well as food for free.
 - Ishen is fairly closed off from mainland politics, and therefore seeing an Ishendi outside of Ishen are a rare sight to see.

<h3 id="Vanadia">Vanadia</h3>

__History and Geography__

The Vanadians are more a loose connection of city-states - each led by a very rich sultan.
They have had a reputation as fine artisans for thousands of years, and has been dubbed the “Land of Immortals” for their above-average medicine and propensity for time magic.
They tend to detest dwarves and halflings for their opinions of the races' stupidity and lack of ambition, respectively.

__Cities__

Generally raised high above the dunes of the Vanadian Desert, the cities have gargantuan windmills taking advantage of the windy desert weather.
Cities are generally only expanded by the citizens and without approval of the sultans, so they tend to have random, chaotic and sometimes even mazelike layouts.

__Hierarchy__
 - Sultans
 - Artisans
 - Working Men
 - Working Women
 - Slaves

__Misc__

 - They are the largest producer of Magical Items and Glassware.
 - General age of maturity is five to four times the normal age
of maturity for a given race due to the effect of time manipulation on societal standards.
 - Chronomancy is heavily limited by a governing body. Called the *Council of Chronoturges*


__Popular Names__

 - Male:
     - Nazeem Sada-Him
     - Mohamed Sikh
     - Dinesh Fafsa
 - Female:
     - Nadia Sada-Him
     - Alecha Sikh
     - Demoira Fafsa

__Cuisine__

Food is expensive here due to the abundant time magic able to freeze the time of hunger and thirst.
Plain bread and water is available to travelers at inns.

__Chronomancy__

All time magic has a clause allowing it to be regulated by the Chronomancy Council.
To learn an unregulated Vanadian Chronomancy is a valuable thing indeed.

__Government and Current Relations__

Vanadia has always had excellent relations with other nations,
especially Balhaea, where they often export their crafts to sell.
Their City-States are ruled by Immortal Sultans, usually rich artisan-chronomancers who rose to power.

__War__

Vanadia has split into two, named after the sultans who split them.
They have been engaged in a civil war for 40 years now, over the accessibility of their knowledge.
The war is fought by the Cierrovanadians, who wish to keep Vanadian chronomancies a secret to the world, and the Herrovanadians, who
wish to share it to all who wish to learn.

<h3 id="Marian">The Marian Empire</h3>
Singular "The Marian", plural "The Marians"

__History and Geography__

Historically run by a single king, the Marian Empire has slowly and quietly been taken over by a staunch
Aristocracy; with one family in control of each city.

All throughout the history of the Marian Empire there's been a clear divide between classes. Peasants live
in total squalor, and the working class barely works enough to survive. The nobility, however - live in the
utmost luxury.

The aristocracy has imposed many rules on society, making it reminiscent of old france and england, with their
extremely rigid social rules and gender roles. Beyond that, due to their unique terrain, they are practically infested
with many rare monsters. It is in this thread that the Witcher's guild HQ is build there, instead of in Balhaea, where
all the rest of the guild headquarters are.


__Hierarchy__

 - Aristocrats
 - Merchantry
 - Clerics (No Evil Gods)
 - Artisans
 - Working Class
 - Peasantry
 - Slaves

__Rumors__

There is an omnipresent rumor in the Marian Empire that some in the Marian Aristocracy have converted to beasts - vampire, werewolf, or other. While just a rumor, with no actual proof, it <em> has </em> spread throughout the whole known world...

__Weaponry__

The Marians are the greatest producer of fine melee, ranged, and magical weapons in the world.
Items they create are of superb quality, but unfortunately are left in high demand as it takes a long time to produce such items.

__Popular Names__
 - Male:
       - Jaques Durand
       - Raphael Moreau
       - Alexandre Lorent
 - Female:
       - Sabine Durand
       - Audrey Moreau
       - Caroline Lorent

__Cuisine__
Marians use many sauces paired with complex foods - Assorted meat and vegetable buns are common at all social levels.

<div style="padding-top:10px" />

__Religion__

The Marians are religious enough - they follow Lithan liturgy but not their doctrine - something that causes tension between them.
The church of Mary is usually the only place lower classes may seek refuge and aid; so it is kept by the aristocrats as a way of keeping
them in line. While Lithian priests tend to be fervent to the point of fury, Marian priests are more kind and forgiving, and represent the more "Lawful"
paladins.

__Government and Current Relations__

The Marian Empire is run by aristocrats with only a figurehead government; and all the people know this.
While they do generally leave the lower classes to rot, there are hefty rewards for those illing to either join
the Military or mine in the Mortuary Valley.

__The Chasm__

The Marian empire is currently at war with Hohkirch over control of the Mortuary Valley for its magic wells and abundant rare ores.
The war was started approximately 15 years before over a minor border dispute that spiraled out of control of both governments.

<h3 id="Hohkirch">Hohkirch</h3>

__History and Geography__

The second oldest state in the world, Hohkirch is a Republic and Representative Democracy first and foremost,
but uses direct democracy for the purpose of creating laws. Citizens have passed laws making voting mandatory.
Over thousands of years, voters have decided to support the betterment of the people as a whole instead of the
betterment of the person, leading to some... questionable laws. The people, however, are actually quite fine
with the whole thing. Hohkirch has focused on production and improving their economy after it crashed several
years ago, and as a result have adopted a medieval form of communism. Strangely enough, the people make it work,
and everyone is quite happy with this economic setup.

Historically, Kirks have hated elves because of their percieved fragility, but embrace orcs
and their cousin races because of their hardiness.

__Slavery__
Slavery was recently outlawed in Hohkirch, causing some unrest in the other nations.
They have released a statement saying they would not apply this to the slaves belonging to visitors,
yet still this development was seen as radical, setting everyone else on edge.

__Hierarchy </u>__

 - Voting Citizens
 - Citizens (Underage)
 - Government Agents
 - Outsiders

Their strong alcohol is something they take pride in, though; and
for good reason - it's the best in the world.

__Technology__

Hohkirch's technology is far beyond any other nation's: they harness steam to create everything
from robots servants to assembly arms. The steam is produced however they can, from burning coal
to magic to nuclear fission (facilitated by magic).

__Government and Current Relations__

Leaders are elected by representatives, who are elected by the people. Laws, however, are made
by the people voting directly. Both types of votes are mandatory. Violation of this law
is punished by placing the violator in prison until the next vote is called, where if they vote
on it, they may go free.

<div style="padding-top: 10px" />

__War__

Hohkirch is currently at war with the Marian Empire over the Mortuary Valley. Their extreme
industrial capacity means they currently have the upper hand in the war, even though rumor has it that <thead>
Marians have a trick up their sleeve...

Singular "Balhaean", Plural "Balhaeans"

__History and Geography__

These are the essential venetian traders of the world.
They control the outlets from the inner sea to the ocean,
and have neutral traders from what seems to be the beginning of time.

restrictions on religion, race, or freedom of information

there have been zero wars.

__Guild Politics__

The merchant’s guild actually controls the city, from the politics to the guards,
and even regulates properties and businesses.
Any trader not a part of the guild is wasting his life,
the benefits are numerous and the drawbacks few.
The merchant’s guild is in the center of the City of Balhaea as well as the tallest
building, so it’s impossible to miss.

<h3 id="Savant">The Savantid Island</h3>
The Islanders are referred to as Singular "Savant" or Plural "Savants"

__History and Geography__

Nobody knows how long the savants have existed, and neither do the savants.
A huge volcano sprouts from this tropical island that spouts fumes 24/7. These fumes
make every islander permanently high. As a result, no islander cares much for
history or learning, instead spending their time living off the land and
having fun. Even if they leave, the high can stay with a person for anywhere
from a month to a year after, depending on their constitution.

__Hierarchy__

 - People
 - Animals
 - Trees
 - Dirt

__Legend__

Apparently there are rare magical artifacts in the lava caves, but between the fumes
and the heat, nobody bothers to find them.

__Popular Names__
 - Male: Any
 - Female: Any

__Cuisine__
Tropical Nuts, berries, coconuts, maybe fish or rabbit if they can stumble upon it.

__Government and Current Relations__

Everyone is too high to get organized, but that also means they're
also too high to get into fights. As a result, people are usually sent
to this island as a sort of peaceful, kind exile. Most steer clear, though,
in fear of being trapped forever by the addictive fumes.

<h3 id="Heptalithia">Heptalithia</h3>
Singular "Heptalithian" or Plural "Heptalithians"

__History and Geography__

Heptalithia is the oldest nation on the planet, and the only
one that is older than the Inner Sea Treaty.
It is a harsh land, with mountainous terrian to the west, and a
long slope down to the Balhaean coastal hills to the east.
The north is almost completely frozen solid, and the south border
barely gets even a remotely warm summer.
Native Heptalithians have been and currently are racist towards non-humans,
but there is a special hate towards tiefilings, who they see as
evil, insidious freaks of nature.

 - Jarls, Combined
 - High King
 - Jarls, Individual
 - Merchantry
 - Peoples
 - Peasantry
 - Slaves
 - Tieflings

__Religion__

While not explicitly banned, the High King and Jarls have been conspiring
to choke religion out of the country in order to more easily raise resources
to further their plan of total world domination. This caused a rift with the church,
and caused Holy Lithium to Split from Heptalithia.

A yarl may grant a citizen the title of Thane, allowing them special rights over others.
Humans are generally only respected, with some racism about for any others, but especially tieflings.

__Resources and Magic__

Heptalithia is the number one <u>and</u> number two exporter of raw resources in the world.
The reason for this is that in the Merchants Guild's Tally, food is categorized separately from the
other resources, and since Heptalithia is the foremost exporter of both, they are marked as #1 <em>and</em> #2
in the category's collective.
Heptalithia is also known for its unique brand of magic: they have a great knack for creating and using sonic magics and cold magic.

<h3 id="Holy-Lithium">The Holy Lithian Theocracy</h3>
The Lithian People, referred to as “A Lithian Man”, "A Lithian", plural "Those Lithians", “Those Lithian People”</p>

__History and Geography__

Only 80 years old, Holy Lithium split from Heptalithia due to it's increasing agnosticism.
Fervently religious, this theorcracy is suspicious of any who are not immediately outward saints,
which is to say everyone.
Having only recently won independence from Heptalithia, they must build a history
and legacy from nothing. They have few resources, and treat their citizens almost as slaves,
all under the veneer of "it's the will of the Gods that we perservere".
Due to their identity as a holy nation of the gods, they despise tieflings for their
demonic nature, and Orcs/Half-Orcs for their supposed corruption from purity.
Conversely, they love and accept elves, seeing them as the pinnacle of refined beauty and
essential grace.

__Hierarchy__

 - The Pontiff
 - Bishops
 - Priests
 - Sacred Nuns
 - Followers
 - Outsiders
 - Slaves

of any city in any other state in the known world.

    - Thomas Godson
    - Jeremiah Towbin
    - Joseph Magdalane
 - Female:
    - Elizabeth Godson

__Cuisine__

Food is scarce for this new nation; with no funds or unique
resources, cuisine is composed mainly of bread and water -
if a person is lucky their town's hunter may bring in some fresh
meat which the villagers all share.

__Government and Current Relations__

Holy Lithium is currently tense, fresh off the revolution from eighty years before.
Their haste to join the inner sea union caused ripples as well, with their zealous
and religiously militant ways being the cause of some concern in the rest of the world.

The Lithian Theocracy is run by a Pontiff, the current one a human
named Pontiff Sulhyvan. Below him are the Bishops, which rule with iron
fists over the cities they won from Heptalithia. Lower down are the priests,
who sympathize more with the people's plight and are more loving and gentle.
In addition to these are the Sacred Nuns, an all-female organization of cleric-rogues that
act as the Pontiff's personal guard, and occasionally as an assassination team, for those
"dear citizens of this glorified, godly nation" which may fall out of line.

# Silver Soul Gaming

At Silver Soul Gaming, we believe in sharing, just like our parents taught us. To that end, we're not particular about where our free content ends up, as long as it's credited back to us. We're especially proud to have it here, since we're friends with the people behind this site and regularly swap ideas. Friends are awesome, aren't they?

If you decide you like our products and would like to know more, we're on the net as [Silver Soul Gaming](https://silversoulgaming.com/tabletop-rpgs/), and you're totally welcome to stalk us on social media or hang with us in chat. We're in the business for our fans and the passion we share with them, so we'd love to get to know you. Until then, we wish you an unlikely streak of crit successes, and a total absence of falling rocks.

Good Luck, Have Fun,

Donald "Lone Wolf" Bronson
